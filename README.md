# PROJECT-12: HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is a project made  for my class 12 finals. It is a basic Hotel Management System. Built using Tkinter for GUI and MySQl as the database.
One of my very first significant projects with Python. The mistakes I made in this project taught me the best practices exist for a reason, and that there is always scope for a more efficient system.
